Description: I trained my model over the VisDrone dataset over 20 epochs
---For every epoch, I saved the model and analyze it's performance
---For the first few epochs, the performance was not quite good
---Up to model last21.pt and last22.pt the performance was adequate, but alot of false positives
---However, after a certain amount of epochs, the data may have been overtrained causing performance to drop dramatically


model20.pt
---videoDetect1: detects car up to just before the curve
---videoDetect2: does not detect pedestrian, detects car sometimes up to the curve
			some false positive
---videoDetect3: detects pedetrians at the beginning. Does not detect cyclist
			some false positive on the poles
			detects cyclist as pedetrian at the end right before the bridge

model21.pt
---videoDetect1: detects car and pedestrian at the beginning just before the curve.
			alot of false positive around in the corner
---videoDetect2: detects pedestrian sometimes throughout the course
			alot of false positive
		    detects car all the time
---videoDetect3: detects pedetrians, not cyclist
			some false positive on the sides and the pole
			detects cyclist as pedetrian during the last scene

model22.pt
---videoDetect1: detects car most of the time in the beginning, but failed to detect pedestrian
			detects the car sometimes after the curve
			alot of false positive around in the corner
---videoDetect2: does not detect pedestrian
			detects car mostly all the time around the curve
---videoDetect3: detects cyclist as a car sometimes throughout the video
			does not detect cyclist around the curve, but detects it as a car on the bridge

model23.pt
---videoDetect1: does not detect anything
---videoDetect2: does not detect anything
---videoDetect3: does not detect anything
